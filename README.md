## Business Understanding 


### Introduction


Tanzania is an East African country situated south of the Equator . Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics estimates a population of 61.8 million people. A publication done by World Bank approximates that only  61% of the population has acces to basic water supply , this has been made possible through programs such as the Water Sector Development Program. Since the commencement of the project, Tanzania has made significant progress towards access to water, sanitation and hygiene services, half the population now has access to clean water in the rainy season and two-thirds of the population during the dry season.

Despite the significant progress made, a considerable amount of the population still suffers from adverse effects of inadequate water supply and sanitation. Tanzania has had to contend  with death and disease as an immediate consequence of this with the burden falling heaviest on women, children, the poor and the vulnerable. 

### Problem Statement

>> The UN-Habitat wants to form a partnership with top funders in Tanzania who look to address sustainable development through ensuring clean water supply to communities in Tanzania. The UN-Habitat has taken keen notice on Tanzania’s commitment to expanding access to clean water over the past 7 years , however there is still an estimate of 31,000 deaths each year due to inadequate water and sanitation services. Over 10% of these deaths are preventable.

 An initiative is to be  set up to curb lack of acces to clean water supply  by looking into the distribution of wells in Tanzania and the functionality of water pumps in the existing water wells. Its’s worth noting that some water pumps are functional but in need of maintenance while others are simply non-functional. 

My task as a data scientist is to locate patterns that will enable me predict water pump functionality with the aim of providing insights on the core features that affect water pump functionality. These patterns will enable our stakeholders to accurately predict water pumps that need maintenance and water points that stakeholders should chanel their resources to due to them being non-functional.
